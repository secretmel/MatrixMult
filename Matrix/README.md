This program reads two matrices from files, multiplies them, and saves the result to a new file. The process is as follows:

File Reading:

The program reads two pre-defined files named matrix1.txt and matrix2.txt. (you are welcome to change the values)
Each file contains a matrix of integers, and these matrices are stored in Java arrays.
Matrix Multiplication:

After reading the matrices, the program checks if they can be multiplied (the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix).
If valid, it performs matrix multiplication and creates a new result matrix.

File Writing:

The resulting matrix is written to a file named matrix3.txt.
